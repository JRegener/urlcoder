# urlcoder

This is simple program to encode or decode url path. 
The main perpose to make possible encoding/decoding URL from CMD on windows, for that I create batch scripts which save input arguments into file in UTF-8 encoding, 
and then the saved string is read by the program and the result is printed to the console. 
I pass arguments from file, because for this moment I didn't find normal way to pass arguments via 'args' in UTF-8 encoding to exe.
